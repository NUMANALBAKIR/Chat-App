# Chat-App - using .Net, Angular, SignalR

## Developed fully by Numan, for company Icicle Corporation.
## Please note that, I have not added the project's source code to this repo, because this this is my company's property. However, I have added screenshots of the app so that you can see my work. 

## The app is a live chat app between customers of various websites and agents.
