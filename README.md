# Chat-App - using SignalR, .Net, Angular

### Developed fully by Numan, for company Icicle Corporation.
### Please note that, I have not added the project's source code to this repo, because that is Icicle's property. Only screenshots of the app are here so that you can see my work. 

### The app is a live chat app between customers of various websites and agents.
